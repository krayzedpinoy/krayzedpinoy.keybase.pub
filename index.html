	Here are some things to click on.
		</br>
			 [Google Developer Profile](https://developers.google.com/profile/u/102834347885666524853?utm_source=developers.google.com)- I have noticed that when many unlock the developer settings on their phone, they feel as if they have full control. There's so much to do, so much to learn.
			 </br>
			 [Git Hub Profile](https://github.io/krayzedpinoy)  - Too many people give themselves titles unearned.
			 </br>
			 [Public PGP Key](https://krayzedpinoy.keybase.pub/pgp.txt)- Always verify your resources. I uploaded my keys a while back on the [Public Keyserver](https://keys.openpgp.org/) so it can be verified
			 </br>
			 [Message me with PGP](https://keybase.io/encrypt#krayzedpinoy) - Give it a try

[Linux](https://gnupg.org) - It's already part of Linux. Use the command gpg
[Windows](https://gpg4win.org) - This is where I started
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain) - If you have anything other than an iPhone you're using an Android.
[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instant-pgp/id1497433694) - If you have an iPhone, you're using an iOS
[macOS](https://gpgtools.org/) - Apple Computers
 - [Sign up and join my classroom](https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ4OTM2ODkxNzM4?cjc=zi4nafp) - It's filled with random lessons.
 - [Look at my photos](https://instagram.com/krayzedpinoy) - in Instagram
 - [Check out my Facebook](https://facebook.com/krayzedpinoy) - Oh how wonderful of a past I have had. If I only had the skills and knowledge I've had back then. If any of my friends are seeing this that know of my past during the best and most heart wrenching moments of my life. I miss you all. Despite my lack of memories, I'm sorry for what I have done to myself, and what it has caused y'all to lose.

### FinTech
#### Cryptocurrency
- [Monero](https://getmonero.org) - Simply put. Just imagine a digital version of cash.
- [Monero Offline Wallet Generator](https://krayzedpinoy.keybase.pub/website/monero-wallet-generator/monero-wallet-generator.html) - You can use a privacy browser (Incognito) to click on the link. Then bring your phone into Airplane Mode. After you collect your necessary information, close the broswer, reset your phone, turn off Airplane Mode, and now you have yourself a wallet generated offline. Yay.
- [SupportXMR-GUI](https://krayzedpinoy.keybase.pub/website/supportxmr-gui/index.html)
- [Monero Source Code](https://krayzedpinoy.keybase.pub/website/monero/) - Skeptical. People fear the unknown. Here is the source code.


#### Did you ask me to go somewhere and having a hard time using technology to let me know where you are?

<br/>
Google Maps is a wonderful thing.

#### Look at this potato

- Learn something new everyday.
- Keep it PLUR (Peace, Love, Unity, Respect)
- Everyday is an adventure.
- Our friends represent a little bit of who we are.
- I treat strangers as my friends. My friends as my significant other. My significant other as my world.
- I educate myself because I like to help others.
